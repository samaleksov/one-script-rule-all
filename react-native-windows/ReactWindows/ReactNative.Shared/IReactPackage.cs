    ///    modules or from other parts of the native code (requiring JavaScript
    ///    modules from the package doesn't mean it will automatically be 
    ///    included as a part of the JavaScript bundle, so there should be a 
    ///    corresponding piece of code on JavaScript side that will require the
    ///    implementation of that JavaScript module so that it gets bundled).
    /// 3) Registering custom native views (i.e., view managers) and custom 
    ///    event types.
    /// 4) Registering natively packaged assets/resources (e.g. images) exposed
    ///    to JavaScript.
